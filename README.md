This app started as a small project to learn the fundamentals of a full-stack application. It quickly grew into something much greater than that. Zipiwhisk is a recipe app where users can explore recipes without the fluff. It helps you find the tasty recipes you're looking for in a simple and easy-to-use format.

What makes it so cool?

- Simplicity has been the underlying factor behind all the decisions when creating the UX/UI.
- "We eat first with our eyes"; that's why photos & videos are a crucial part of why this app is so great.
- Adding a social aspect to the app was almost necessary to help bring more fun and excitement to the recipes you make!

I hope this app helps people build a better relationship with food and explore new cuisines, but more importantly, I hope it brings more awareness to the food they are consuming.
